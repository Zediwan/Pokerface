The goal of this Project is to create a Machine Learning Model that is capable of playing poker and learns in real time during a game.
Ideally the model should be capable to use a camera to gain information but in a first phase it will work via input by a player that tells the model what each player does and how much he raises.
Later on it would be cool to explore the posibility of the model analyzing mimics and body language of players with the capability to recognize players and save information about their playstyle to consider when playing a second time against them.
