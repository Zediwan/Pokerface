# __init__.py

# This file can be left empty if you don't have any specific initialization code to include.
# It is commonly used to mark a directory as a Python package.

# If you have any package-level imports or initialization code, you can include them here.

# For example, if you have a module named "game" in the same package, you can import it like this:
# from . import game

# You can also define any package-level variables or functions here.

# Remember to include the necessary imports and code based on your project's requirements.
